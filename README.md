# Vegitation_Raindeer_Population_Dynamics
Vegetation–Reindeer Population Dynamics Simulation (Threshold-Based Grazing Model)
This Python code simulates the interaction between lichen (vegetation) and a reindeer population over 200 years using a simple time-stepping (Euler) method. It starts by defining model parameters and initial values for lichen biomass and reindeer numbers, then updates both at each small time step based on growth and loss rules. Lichen grows logistically toward a maximum carrying capacity, but decreases due to natural mortality and grazing. Grazing and reindeer population dynamics change depending on whether lichen is above or below a critical threshold (α): when lichen is plentiful, reindeer grazing increases with population size and reindeer reproduce in proportion to how much they graze; when lichen falls below the threshold, reproduction stops and grazing follows a different rule, while mortality increases if lichen becomes scarce. Finally, the script plots lichen biomass and reindeer population through time and marks the critical lichen level with a dashed horizontal line to show when the system crosses into low-resource conditions.
